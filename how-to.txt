0. Assume we have a source code of an application(Order Management using SpringBoot).

1. Make sure you are in top directory of the project. If not (cd to the correct path)

2. create a file named DockerFile (this would be a configuration for the image you are about to create)

3. add the correct configuration. for example: a SpringBoot app needed the following: 
    "# Use a base image with Java 17
    FROM openjdk:17-jdk

    # Set the working directory inside the container
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the build files and dependencies
    COPY build/libs/*.jar app.jar

    # Expose the port the application will run on
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Define the command to run when the container starts
    CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]"
4. use the command:  docker build -t order-management .
    ** you now should have a docker image of the app.

5. To run the image use the command:  docker run -p 8080:8080 order-management 
    # 8080:8080 is so that we expose to port 8080
